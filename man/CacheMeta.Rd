\usage{
CacheMeta(family_id = character(0), source = character(0), files = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{family_id}{(\code{character(1)}) A non-empty safe identifier for the font family. Allowed characters: letters,
digits and hyphen (no spaces, slashes, dots, colons, tildes, etc.).}

\item{source}{(\code{character(1)}) Name of the provider or source that produced the cached font files.}

\item{files}{(\verb{list(1+)}) A non-empty named list of file paths. Names are weight identifiers (e.g., "400" for normal weight 400,
"400italic" for italic weight 400). Each element is a character(1) path to the local font files.}
}
\value{
(\code{S7_object}) A validated S7 \code{CacheMeta} object.

\details{
The \code{added} property is a getter-only field that returns the current timestamp as a character string when accessed. It cannot be set during construction.

Weights are not explicitly stored - they are derived from the names of the files list.
Registration functions are responsible for selecting appropriate weights for regular/bold variants.
